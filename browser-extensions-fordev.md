In this article, we will look at 20 different browser extensions that can be useful to web developers in 2024. All of these extensions are available for Google Chrome, but most are also available in Firefox and other browsers. 

This isn't in any particular order and there's no ranking involved. I'm also leaving off extensions like the React and Vue devtools, Clockwork for Laravel, and other framework-specific extensions because I want this list to be more general and not just for one specific framework or language. Since HTML, CSS and JS are the core of frontend web development, some of these extensions are geared towards those technologies.

I find browser extensions super useful for 3 major things.

1.  **Getting information from other websites** - Code, colors, fonts, technologies, etc. When I create a website or layout, I use a lot of other websites for inspiration. So it's nice to see what's going on under the hood.
2.  **Developing, testing, and debugging my own projects** \- These extensions are very helpful if I need to find broken links, check performance, or test different screen sizes.
3.  **Productivity** - I like to quickly fill out forms, save things, take notes, manage my tabs, and other similar tasks. So**,** there are a few extensions that help with that.

The first few extensions are for getting information from other websites.

1\. ColorZilla
--------------

![](https://kajabi-storefronts-production.kajabi-cdn.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/file-uploads/blogs/2147509817/images/4f1367-4e42-8377-ba4a-30e86416c63_colorzilla.png)

**ColorZilla** is a color picker and gradient generator that you can use to get the color of any pixel on a webpage. This is great for web design because, a lot of the time, when we're creating layouts, we use other sites for inspiration. So if you see a color you like, you can use ColorZilla to get the hex code quickly. You can click on the color picker and then click anywhere to get that color. You can even use it outside of the browser now, which is really cool. You can even create gradients and save them to your library. So if you're creating UIs and layouts, this is definitely a must-have.

2\. WhatFont
------------

**WhatFont** is in the same realm as ColorZilla. you may see a font that you really like and wany to use and instead of digging through the sites CSS files, you can just use this extension to find out which font is being used. You can click on the WhatFont icon and then hover over any text on the page to see what font it is. You can also click on the text to get more information like the font size, line height, and color.

3\. Wappalyzer
--------------

**Wappalyzer** is a technology profiler that shows you what technologies are being used on a website. So if you're on a website and you're curious what it's built with, you can click on the Wappalyzer icon and it will show you what technologies are being used. So for example, if we go to [https://wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org), we can see that it's built with WordPress, obviously. It will show you programming languages, databases, web servers, frameworks, and more. If we go to [https://react.dev](https://react.dev), we can see that it's built with Next.js. My website, [https://traversymedia.com](https://traversymedia.com) uses the Kajabi platform for video and ecommerce, Ruby, Cloudinary for images, some JS libraries, and more. So it's a cool way to see what's going on under the hood of a website.

4\. Web Developer
-----------------

Web Developer is a very popular extension that adds a toolbar with various web developer tools. A lot of this stuff is available with the standard devtools in most browsers, but this adds a lot more granularity. You have more cookie and session management. I like that you can quickly disable all JavaScript and CSS styles. You can disable the default browser styles. Edit the CSS files directly in real-time within an efficient layout. You can do all types of stuff with forms like check all checkboxes,convert certain input types to other types, remove validation, display form details and a lot more. For images, you can disable them, make them full size, outline background images, display alt attributes, etc. You can quickly resize the window to specific values. You can validate your HTML, CSS, links and accessibility and so much more. I think it's worth having installed for any front-end developer.

**Dark Reader** is a popular extension allowing you to enable dark mode on any website. It's easier on your eyes and it's also great for web developers because you can see how your site looks in dark mode. You can enable it on a per-site basis or globally. You can adjust the brightness, contrast, sepia, and more. You can also exclude certain sites if you want. I use this all the time and it's a must-have for me because I actually have issues with eye floaters and they flare up when I look at bright screens for a long time.

**JSON Formatter** is a simple extension that formats JSON data in a more readable way. So if you're working with APIs and you get a JSON response, it can be hard to read if it's not formatted.

We still have the option to view the raw data without the formatting as well.

**Session Buddy** is a session manager that allows you to view, save and restore your browser sessions. So if you have a bunch of tabs open and you want to save them for later, you can click on the Session Buddy icon and save them. You can also name the session and add notes. You can then restore them at any time. You can also export and import sessions. I use this all the time because I have a lot of tabs open and I like to save them for later. I also like that you can search through your sessions.

Fake Filler is a form filler that allows you to quickly fill out forms with fake data.

You can also create custom profiles and save them. It's a very useful extension for testing and productivity. I use it all the time and I'm going to start using it in courses and tutorials because I know you guys don't like watching me type out dummy data into a form every time we test.

**VisBug** is a design tool that allows you to make changes to a webpage visually. You can click on the VisBug icon and then click on any element to make changes. You can edit content locally from the regular devtools, but this is a much more efficient way to do it. You can change the text, the color, the size, the position, and more.

LT Debug is a pretty advanced and in-depth debug and testing tool. You can add/remove headers, block and redirect requests, change user agents, throttle responses, manage CORS and more. Just to give you an example, we can click on "Modify Headers" and give it a rule name,header name and value, apply it to a URL and save. Now when you go to a URL where this rul is applied and open up the devtools, you'll see the header in the request.

**IE Tab** is an extension that allows you to view a webpage in Internet Explorer. This is great for testing how your site looks in older versions of IE. Now I know many developers including myself don't really care about IE anymore, but if you're working on a project that requires it, this is a great tool. You can click on the IE Tab icon and it will open the current page in IE. You can also add custom URLs to open in IE. You can set up exceptions and there's a bunch of options including the version of IE.
